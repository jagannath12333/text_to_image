🎨 Fine-Tuned Stable Diffusion for Marketing & Advertising

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune Stable Diffusion with LoRA adapters to generate custom marketing visuals. Instead of relying on generic pretrained models or stock images, this pipeline enables brands to create highly specific, brand-aligned advertising content.

🚀 Project Objectives

✅ Fine-tune Stable Diffusion (LoRA-based) on a custom dataset of marketing/ad visuals.

✅ Deploy the fine-tuned model in a cloud environment (Hugging Face Spaces, AWS, GCP, or Azure).

✅ Provide a Gradio-based web UI for easy text-to-image generation.

✅ Open-source all training + inference code in this GitHub repo with clear documentation.

🏋️ Fine-Tuning (LoRA Training)

Run the training script on your dataset:

python train.py


This will create LoRA adapter weights inside MarketingModel_LoRA/.

🌐 Deployment

You can deploy the project on:

Hugging Face Spaces (recommended for free + fast prototyping)

AWS Sagemaker

GCP Vertex AI

Azure ML

In Spaces, just upload the repo with:

app.py

requirements.txt

MarketingModel_LoRA/

▶️ Inference

Run locally:

python app.py


This launches a Gradio web UI.

Input your prompt → Get AI-generated ad visuals.

📢 Example Prompt
"Professional advertising photo of a coffee brand on a clean studio background, cinematic lighting, 4k resolution"

📊 Example Use Cases

📸 Product Photography – Generate ad-ready visuals without expensive shoots.

📰 Social Media Campaigns – On-demand custom graphics.

🏢 Corporate Branding – Keep a consistent creative style across materials.

🎯 Targeted Ads – Generate images aligned to specific audiences.

📝 Notes

This project uses LoRA fine-tuning for efficiency (much faster & cheaper than full fine-tuning).

Default base model: runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5.

Fine-tuned adapter files (adapter_model.safetensors, adapter_config.json) are stored in MarketingModel_LoRA/.
